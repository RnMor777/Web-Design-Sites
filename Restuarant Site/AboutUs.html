		<p id="para2">
		When we first started this company in 1999, we were small and unknown. We have committed ourselves to using the best possible beef and chicken, so that our guest will have a good time. Our founder, Founder McGuy, built this restaurant into a thriving business where all could enjoy his cooking. We plan on opening other sites soon. <br><br>
		
		We use only the best quality meat we can find. All of our meat is grass fed and free-ranged. Grass-fed beef may have some heart-health benefits that other types of beef don't have. When compared with other types of beef, grass-fed beef may have:<br>
		<ul id="uls">
			<li>Less total fat</li>
			<li>More heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids</li>
			<li>More conjugated linoleic acid, a type of fat that's thought to reduce heart disease and cancer risks</li>
			<li>More antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin E</li>
		</ul>
